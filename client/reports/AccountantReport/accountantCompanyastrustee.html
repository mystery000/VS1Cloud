The financial statements are therefore special purpose financial statements that have been prepared in order to meet the requirements of the trust deed, the information needs of stakeholders and for the basis of preparation of the income tax return. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the significant accounting policies disclosed below, which the directors have determined are appropriate to meet the purposes of preparation. Such accounting policies are consistent with the previous period unless stated otherwise. The financial statements have been prepared on an accruals basis and are based on historical costs unless otherwise stated in the notes.

                                        Current income tax expense charged to the profit or loss is the tax payable on taxable income calculated using applicable
                                        income tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, as at the end of the reporting period. Current tax liabilities are therefore

                                        depreciation and impairment losses. Plant and equipment that has been contributed at no cost, or for nominal cost, is valued
                                        and recognised at the fair value of the asset at the date it is acquired. The plant and equipment is reviewed annually by directors
                                        to ensure that the carrying amount is not in excess of the recoverable amount from these assets. The recoverable amount is

                                        Freehold land and buildings are measured at their fair value, based on periodic, but at least triennial, valuations by independent
                                        external valuers, less subsequent depreciation for buildings.
                                        Increases in the carrying amount of land and buildings arising on revaluation are credited in equity to a revaluation surplus.
                                        Decreases against previous increases of the same asset are charged against fair value reserves in equity. All other decreases are
                                        charged to profit or loss.
                                        Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is offset against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net

                                        receive the economic benefits of the grant and the amount can be reliably measured.
                                        If the grant has conditions attached which must be satisfied before the entity is eligible to receive the grant, the recognition of
                                        the revenue will be deferred until those conditions are satisfied.
                                        Where the entity incurs an obligation to deliver economic value back to the grant contributor, the transaction is considered a
                                        reciprocal transaction and the revenue is recognised as a liability in the balance sheet until the required service has been
                                        completed, otherwise the income is recognised on receipt.
                                        Demo Company (AU) receives non-reciprocal contributions of assets from the government and other parties for a nominal or
                                        zero value. These assets are recognised at their fair value on the date of acquisition in the balance sheet, with an equivalent
                                        amount of income recognised in the income statement.
                                        Donations and bequests are recognised as revenue when received.</span>
